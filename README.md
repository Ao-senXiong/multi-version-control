# mvc: multi-version-control

Lets you run a version control command, such as `status` or `update`, on
a set of CVS/Git/Hg/SVN checkouts rather than just one.

See [Javadoc documentation in the source
code](https://github.com/plume-lib/multi-version-control/blob/master/src/main/java/org/plumelib/multiversioncontrol/MultiVersionControl.java);
formatted Javadoc as HTML is forthcoming.
